Recently, I came across the "Global Power Plant Database" by the World Resources Institute. 
This dataset provides information about the location, fuel type, capacity, and other characteristics of power plants worldwide. 
It currently includes data on over 35,000 power plants in over 167 countries.

I find this dataset interesting because it has the potential to help inform policy decisions related to energy and climate change.
By analyzing the data, researchers can identify trends and patterns in power generation across different countries and regions, and assess the impact of different types 
of energy sources on the environment.
It can also be used to build predictive models to forecast energy demand and inform decisions related to infrastructure planning and investment.
